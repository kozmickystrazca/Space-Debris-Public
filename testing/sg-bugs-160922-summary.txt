SPACE GUARDIAN BUGS 16.9.2022 

BUGS NOT RELATED TO PLATFORM OR A SPECIFIC BROSWER:

1. When choosing a satellite for example in year 1958 or 1959,
   satellite is being tracked by "camera" for a while, then loader runs and all objects disappear.
   This is probably caused by zoom filter.

2. When using button controls for moving the globe, "camera" is being zoomed out a bit after every pressed control.
   Feature or bug?

3. When choosing an object that is lower than our current zoom filter and randomly clicking on screen while loader is 
   applying zoom filter, modal window with object specs disappear, but object is still highlighted.

PC - Firefox:

1. Firefox has a feature for minimizing a video that is currently running. This causes an issue in our title screen, as
   we are using Earth video for background. We can minimize this video using browser built-in feature, so video is then
   positioned in right bottom corner and background is therefore black. Not sure if this is fixable, from our POV.

BUGS RELATED TO A PHONE (not depending on browser or OS):

1. When trying to zoom or control the globe using gestures, often we will select a random object we didn't intend to,
   therefore modal window with specs of this random object opens. Consider turning off gestures for phone devices as
   this leads to other unwanted bugs.

=======================================================================================================================

Phone - iPhone SE 2020 - Safari:

1. When trying to zoom using gestures, after loader comes up (for applying zoom filter), we are allowed to zoom whole
   web page instead of just application (Earth).

=======================================================================================================================

Phone - Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 - Chrome:

1. Poor performance even after filters applied - old phone with weak hardware.

OTHER ISSUES:

1. Update text, links and information in "Read more".
