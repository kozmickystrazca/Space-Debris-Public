This folder is desired for running automatic tests of basic functions and use cases that Space Guardian has.
- REQUIRED: Python, Selenium Webdriver and browser driver used for testing are required. (Tested using Chrome Webdriver),
- in file "init_driver.py" overwrite absolute path to your webdriver.exe file,
- file "functions.py" contains all important functions, which are used in all tests,
- to run a test, run a chosen python file. For example: "test_zoom.py", wait until test finishes and check for result in terminal (PASSED/FAILED).
