# Space debris

The role of the cosmic guardian is to protect our Earth and space technology from damage. Satellites in Earth's orbit can be hit by parts of malfunctioning satellites - space debris. When your grandparents were your age, the space guardian didn't have much to do because there were only a few functional satellites orbiting the Earth. Today there are around 5,000 of them. But the problem is that there are also more than 30,000 pieces of hazardous space debris. It is necessary to monitor this waste and subsequently adjust the positions of active satellites in order to avoid unwanted collisions.
