# Space debris

The role of the cosmic guardian is to protect our Earth and space technology from damage. Satellites in Earth's orbit can be hit by parts of malfunctioning satellites - space debris. When your grandparents were your age, the space guardian didn't have much to do because there were only a few functional satellites orbiting the Earth. Today there are around 5,000 of them. But the problem is that there are also more than 30,000 pieces of hazardous space debris. It is necessary to monitor this waste and subsequently adjust the positions of active satellites in order to avoid unwanted collisions.

## What is space debris?

- malfunctioning satellites,
- rocket bodies,
- Fragments of cosmic objects.

## Why is it dangerous?
- the speed of space debris is ~ 28,000 km/h. Imagine a collision at that speed.
## How much debris is there in the cosmos?
- more than 36,000 objects with a diameter of >10 cm
- more than 1,000,000 objects with a diameter of 1-10 cm
- more than 130,000,000 objects with a diameter of 0.1 - 1 cm
- the total weight of space debris is estimated at 10,100 tons. For example, that's how much the Eiffel Tower in Paris weighs.
## Does it need to be monitored?
- Yes. It is currently the only way to prevent collisions. If we know where hazardous space debris is located, we will be able to command a functioning satellite to perform an evasive maneuver.
## How to get rid of space debris?
- As with waste, especially everyone should try not to produce it.
- In the next few years, space missions are planned that will actively remove space debris.
